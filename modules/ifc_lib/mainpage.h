/**
\mainpage Introduction

The Link Labs Interface library (ll_ifc) allows an <b>external host</b>, 
to communicate with low-power, wide-area 
networks using Link Lab's modules.  These modules implement the
low-level radio software and higher level media access control (MAC).  
The modules use a Frequency Modulated Chirp (Semtech's LoRa&trade;
modulation) to maximize range while minimizing power consumption and
interference.  

This documentation describes how an external host should use the library.
The documentation is intended for software developers responsible for 
incorporating this networking into their products.  This library combined with
Link Lab's modules allows software developers to 
quickly and easily add support low-power, wide-area networking to products.
